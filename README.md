# React Coffee Shop Application

This is an application that allows users to order coffee from a store using their mobile device.

## Shop Page
This page contains all the beverages the coffee shop offers. Customers can click the "Add to Cart" icon to add the beverage to the cart. Once they are ready, customers can press the cart in the top-right corner of the website to enter the cart.
